/*User Story: Random Password Generator
As a USER,
I want to be able to generate a random password based on my preferences,
so that I can create a secure password easily.
Acceptance Criteria:
  WHEN I am prompted,
  THEN I can select how many characters I want my password to be.
  WHEN I am prompted,
  THEN I can select if I want uppercase letters included.
  WHEN I am prompted,
  THEN I can select if I want numbers included.
  WHEN I am prompted,
  THEN I can select if I want special characters included.
  WHEN I have finished answering the prompts,
  THEN I can click "Submit."
FINALLY,
I will be presented with my randomly generated password.
Good Luck!!*/
